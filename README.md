# NMG Identity Automation With Powershell

PowerShell tooling for identity lifecycle management, built for
Northstar Medical Group.

## The Problem

Northstar's offboarding process lived in one person's box.
When someone left the company, she'd email IT. That was it.
That was the whole system.

Then she retired. Nobody replaced the process,just the person.
It took 102 days before anyone realized accounts were sitting active
with nobody behind them.

Someone eventually did it by hand. 23 stale accounts, 11 hours , spread across four days.
Even then, it couldn't catch everything, no way to spot people whose
departure was never logged anywhere,, contractors who never showed up in a payroll,
or service accounts that were never tied to a person in the first place.

## The Approach

Stop trusting paperwork.Ask the domain controller instead.

Every account has a last authentication date. It doesn't care if
HR filed the right form or it two systems spell someone's name the same way.
It just knows when someone last logged in, of if they never did.

## Before you start

- Windows Server with the ActiveDirectory PowerShell module

      Import-Module ActiveDirectory

- Rights to modify user objects in the domain
- An authorising ticket number, in the form NMG-0000
- A Disabled Users OU at the root of the domain
- A writable reports folder. Create it if it does not exist:

      New-Item -Path "C:\Reports\Offboarding" -ItemType Directory -Force


## Tools

### Find-StaleAccounts.ps1

Flags enabled accounts that haven't authenticated in X days, plus accouts that
have never authenticated at all.Every run produces a timestampped CSV and a
summary file, so the exact question behind the numbers never gets lost.
.\Find-StaleAccounts.ps1
    .\Find-StaleAccounts.ps1 -Days 30
    .\Find-StaleAccounts.ps1 -Days 180 -IncludeDisabled

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-Days` | int | 90 | Days without authentication before an account is considered stale |
| `-ReportPath` | string | C:\Reports | Where reports are written |
| `-IncludeDisabled` | switch | off | Include disabled accounts in results |

**Output:** a timestamped CSV with findings, and a summary file that spells
exactly what was asked to get them. Anyone can pick it up later and reproduce it.

### Offboard-NMGUser.ps1

Performs all five steps of SOP-IAM-001 against a single account.
Documents the account and its group memberships, verifies that
record on disk, disables the account, stamps the authorising
ticket, removes all group memberships, and moves the account to
the Disabled Users OU.

    .\Offboard-NMGUser.ps1 -Username "jdoe" -Ticket "NMG-0214" -WhatIf
    .\Offboard-NMGUser.ps1 -Username "jdoe" -Ticket "NMG-0214"

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-Username` | string | required | SamAccountName of the account to offboard |
| `-Ticket` | string | required | Authorising ticket, in the form NMG-0000 |
| `-ReportPath` | string | C:\Reports\Offboarding | Where evidence files are written |
| `-LogPath` | string | Logs\ | Where the run transcript is written |
| `-WhatIf` | switch | off | Runs every check and changes nothing |

**Output:** two timestamped CSV files per account recording what
it was and what it could reach, plus a transcript of the run.

### Get-NMGOffboardingStatus.ps1

Reports how many accounts have been offboarded and quarantined,
how many are offboarded but not yet moved, and how many are still
waiting. Takes no parameters and makes no changes of any kind.

    .\Get-NMGOffboardingStatus.ps1

**Output:** three counts and two named lists, printed to the
console. Nothing is written to disk.


### Invoke-BulkValidation.ps1

Reads a separations list, cleans a copy, checks every row against
Active Directory, and writes a report for human review plus an
approved list for the bulk script. Contains no command that can
modify an account.

    .\Invoke-BulkValidation.ps1 -InputFile ".\Evidence\<the file>.csv"

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-InputFile` | string | required | The separations file, as received. Never modified |
| `-OutputPath` | string | C:\Reports\Separations | Where the cleaned copy, report and approved list go |

**Output:** `Separations_dropped.csv`, `Validation-Report.txt`,
and `Approved.csv`. The report is for a person. The approved list
is for the bulk script.

### Invoke-BulkOffboarding.ps1

Runs all five steps of SOP-IAM-001 against every account on an
approved list. Each account is atomic: it completes or is rolled
back. Every outcome is written to disk the moment it is known.
Stops after 3 consecutive failures.

    .\Invoke-BulkOffboarding.ps1 -ApprovedList ".\Evidence\Approved.csv" -Ticket "NMG-0000" -WhatIf
    .\Invoke-BulkOffboarding.ps1 -ApprovedList ".\Evidence\Approved.csv" -Ticket "NMG-0000"

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-ApprovedList` | string | required | The approved list from Invoke-BulkValidation |
| `-Ticket` | string | NMG-0215 | Authorising ticket, stamped on every account |
| `-OutputPath` | string | C:\Reports\Offboarding | Where evidence and results are written |
| `-BreakOn` | string | empty | Test hook. Simulates a failure on matching accounts. Does nothing unless passed |
| `-WhatIf` | switch | off | Runs every step and changes nothing |

**Output:** two CSV files per completed account, a `BulkRun_*.csv`
results file with one line per account, a summary naming every
account that did not complete, and a transcript in `Logs/`.


## When the script refuses

A refusal is the tool working correctly. It stops before making
any change at all, and tells you why.

| Message | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| no account named X | The username is wrong, or the account is already gone | Check the spelling in Active Directory |
| already disabled | Somebody has handled this one before you | Read the description field for the ticket number |
| looks like a service account | This is not a person | Find the owner. It needs a different procedure |
| ticket should look like NMG-0000 | The ticket format is wrong | Use the full four digit form |
| export file is empty | The record could not be written | Check the reports folder exists and is writable |
| Disabled Users OU not found | The destination is missing | Steps 1 to 4 completed. Move the account by hand |

| not a username | An ID or a display name in the username column | Correct it at source, or drop the row |
| duplicate of row N | Same person listed twice | No action. Handled at row N |
| STILL EMPLOYED | The person appears to still work here | Do not proceed. Ask the Privacy Officer |
| STRANDED | A step failed and the rollback failed too | Manual review. The account is named in the results file |



## What an offboarding leaves behind

- Two timestamped CSV files per account in `Evidence/`. One
  records the account, one records every group it could reach.
- One transcript per run in `Logs/`, naming every membership
  removed.
- The authorising ticket number stamped on the account
  description in Active Directory.

The CSV of group memberships is the only record that will ever
exist of what an account could reach beforehand. Active Directory keeps no
history of a removed memberships.


## Known limitations

- Three accounts were offboarded before step 5 was implemented
  and were moved into the Disabled Users OU manually afterwards.
  Their logs do not record the move.
- The service account check matches on a name prefix and a
  department. An unusually named service account could get past it.
- STILL EMPLOYED is inferred from a recent logon. It is a signal
  for a person to check, not a verdict.
